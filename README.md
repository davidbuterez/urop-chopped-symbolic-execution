There is a Git repository which contains a single C source file: https://github.com/davidbuterez/password-example
This repo is to be used to get example diffs.

In the 'Experiment' folder there is currently a simple C source file, 'password.c'. There is a script to generate CFG and Call Graphs (saved as images). See 'Description.txt' for more details.

Experiments for a shortest path pass and similar ideas should use the files in 'Experiment'.
